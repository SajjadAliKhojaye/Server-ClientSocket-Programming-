# Server-ClientSocket-Programming-
Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(server) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket (server) reaches out to the other to form a connection. The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server.
